snap (Super Nintendo Assembling Program) is a multi-pass 65816 assembler.

snap is GPL'd software.
If you want to change it or improve it, please do so for everyone. Thanks!

USAGE:
snap [-s <sym-file>] <in-file> <out-file>

(<sym-file> is where the assembler will dump its symbol table in the end.
 This way you can easily determine what address a procedure is located at,
 so you can add breakpoints or whatever)

Syntax generally follows that laid out in the WDC 65816 docs and datasheets.

COMPILING:
  just compiling all the C files and linking them together should do it.
  One day I might write a makefile. 

  gcc -ansi -Wall -g -c *.c
  gcc -ansi -Wall -g *.o -o snap

TODO:
-absolute modifiers
-more math/expression parsing - right now snap only supports + and -
-a bunch more directives
-more features for the existing directives
-riddled with bugs I am sure
-a makefile

WHAT'S DONE:
-all instructions/addressing modes
-very very basic math/expression parsing
-multipass optimization
-memmap output - very handy!
